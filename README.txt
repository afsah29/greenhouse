Greenhouse monitoringThe aim of the project is to monitor the environment of a Greenhouse. The greenhouse needs to have a specific environment to grow. For example, it needs to have a pH between 5.5 and 6.5, a water pH levels between 6.2 to 6.5 and a temperature between 70F to 75F in order to be healthy. If these conditions are not met it can impact the plant. The user would use the keyboard to input values. In the circumstance the input is out of the boundaries, the monitor will print out a solution to show to the person what they could do in such a scenario and also indicate the associated risks if it is not taken care of. For example, if the input pH of the soil is more than 6.5, the program would suggest adding aluminum sulfate or sulfuric acid and would also inform the user that if the pH isn’t reduced it would cause gaps in nutrient availability and the presence of high concentrations of minerals that are harmful to plants. The program ends when the greenhouse environment is completely fine for plant growth.
